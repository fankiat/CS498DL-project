* Description


** Some background on PINN
   Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) are models trained to solve
   supervised learning tasks while adhering to given laws of physics cite:raissi2019physics described
   by general nonlinear partial differential equations (nPDEs). Recent works on
   PINN have shown promise in instantly predicting results for temporally
   evolving nPDEs in problems across scientific domains, for example in
   incompressible fluid dynamics, reaction--diffusion systems in phase
   transition and computational chemistry, and the propagation of nonlinear
   waves in quantum mechanics. Additionally, it can also generate solutions for
   boundary value problems in complex domains, such as those found in continuum
   solid mechanics.

** Deliverables
   1. We propose to implement the algorithm for such PINN and validate it
      against a time-dependent problem drawn from the paper (such as the Burgerâ€™s
      equation) as well as against a time-independent boundary value problem
      with known (numerical) solutions (such as Laplace or Poisson equation).
   2. Finally, if time permits, we will extend the method for solving problems
      of higher complexity. In particular, we are interested in solving problems
      in the field of fluid mechanics cite:jin2020nsfnets,raissi2020hidden, with
      focus on problems where where no known analytical solutions are available
      and direct numerical simulation approaches are
      computationally expensive.
